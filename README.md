# quagroom

Quagroom.com was a website I created to share rap beats I made. The website went live in June of 2022 and will expire on February 12, 2023.

I wrote all code for the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is meant to have an old-school coding aesthetic. The actual beats are not available through this repository.
