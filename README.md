# quagroom

Quagroom.com was a website I created to share rap beats I made. The website went live in June of 2022 and will expire on February 12, 2023.

I wrote all code for the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is meant to have an old-school coding aesthetic. 

Visitors to the website could both preview and download the beats. Pressing "PLAY" for a beat would bring up the word "NULL" and "0". Pressing NULL would end the beat. Pressing 0 would pause the beat. The zero would then change to a 1, which would resume the beat when pressed.

The actual beats are not available through this repository.
